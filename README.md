Credit Card Fraud Analysis Report

This report presents a detailed analysis of credit card fraud data based on key factors such as the use of PIN, transaction type (in-person vs. online), and purchase amount ratios. Insights from these factors will guide the implementation of measures to reduce fraud risks.

1. Fraud Rate: With vs Without PIN

The chart below compares fraud rates when a PIN is used versus when it is not used.

Without PIN: Fraud rate is alarmingly high at 9.69%.

With PIN: Fraud rate drops significantly to 0.27%.

Insight: Requiring PINs for transactions dramatically reduces the likelihood of fraud. PINs provide an additional layer of security, making it much harder for fraudsters to carry out unauthorized transactions.

Recommendation:

Encourage or mandate PIN usage for all credit card transactions.

Provide incentives for users to regularly update their PINs.

Implement multi-factor authentication for high-risk transactions.

2. Fraud Rate: In-Person vs Online Transactions

This chart compares fraud rates between in-person and online transactions.

In-Person: Fraud rate is significantly lower at 1.34%.

Online: Fraud rate is much higher at 12.71%.

Insight: Online transactions pose a higher risk for fraud compared to in-person transactions. This could be due to the ease with which fraudulent transactions can be carried out online, often with less stringent authentication procedures.

Recommendation:

Strengthen online transaction security with methods like two-factor authentication (2FA) or biometric verification (fingerprint/face ID).

Use tokenization for sensitive data transmission.

Monitor and flag transactions from unusual locations or devices.

3. Purchase Amount Ratio: Legitimate vs Fraud

The scatter plot shows the ratio of purchase amount to median purchase price for legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

Legitimate Purchases: Most transactions are clustered near the lower range of the ratio, meaning legitimate purchases tend to follow a normal spending pattern.

Fraudulent Purchases: Fraudulent transactions show a significant number of outliers with very high purchase ratios, indicating that fraudsters often make larger-than-normal purchases relative to the median.

Insight: Fraudulent transactions tend to be disproportionately higher in value when compared to legitimate transactions. This suggests that fraudsters often make attempts to purchase expensive goods quickly before the fraud is detected.

Recommendation:

Implement real-time monitoring and alerts for large or outlier purchases, especially those above a predefined threshold.

Use machine learning models to detect abnormal spending patterns and flag transactions in real-time.

Apply purchase limits for new accounts or for transactions with unusual characteristics until they establish a reliable spending history.

Summary of Insights and Recommendations

PIN Requirement: Always require a PIN for card transactions. This simple security measure drastically reduces fraud risk.

Online Transaction Security: Given the higher fraud rate in online transactions, implement stronger authentication mechanisms like two-factor authentication and biometric checks.

Transaction Monitoring: Focus on monitoring high-value transactions, especially those with unusually large purchase ratios. Real-time fraud detection systems should be in place to alert users and financial institutions.

Customer Awareness: Regularly educate users about safe practices, including the importance of keeping PINs confidential and recognizing phishing attempts.

By adopting these measures, the risk of credit card fraud can be significantly minimized, protecting both consumers and financial institutions from substantial losses.
